    "# Tutorial: Creating Your First QA Pipeline with Retrieval-Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Level**: Beginner\n",
    "- **Time to complete**: 10 minutes\n",
    "- **Components Used**: [`InMemoryDocumentStore`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/inmemorydocumentstore), [`SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencetransformersdocumentembedder), [`SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencetransformerstextembedder), [`InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/inmemoryembeddingretriever), [`PromptBuilder`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/promptbuilder), [`OpenAIChatGenerator`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/openaichatgenerator)\n",
    "- **Prerequisites**: You must have an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).\n",
    "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you'll have learned the new prompt syntax and how to use PromptBuilder and OpenAIChatGenerator to build a generative question-answering pipeline with retrieval-augmentation."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows you how to create a generative question-answering pipeline using the retrieval-augmentation ([RAG](https://www.deepset.ai/blog/llms-retrieval-augmentation)) approach with Haystack. The process involves four main components: [SentenceTransformersTextEmbedder](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/sentencetransformerstextembedder) for creating an embedding for the user query, [InMemoryBM25Retriever](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/inmemorybm25retriever) for fetching relevant documents, [PromptBuilder](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/promptbuilder) for creating a template prompt, and [OpenAIChatGenerator](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/openaichatgenerator) for generating responses.\n",

    "For this tutorial, you'll use the Wikipedia pages of [Seven Wonders of the Ancient World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_World) as Documents, but you can replace them with any text you want.\n"

      "Rabies is transmitted in dogs primarily through the bite of an infected animal. When an infected animal bites a dog, the virus present in the saliva enters the bloodstream through the wound. Additionally, rabies can also be transmitted if the saliva from an infected animal comes into contact with the dog’s mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose, or mouth. The disease is highly contagious among warm-blooded animals, with dogs being a significant vector for transmission to humans. Once the virus enters the dog’s body, it travels along the nerves to the central nervous system, leading to the disease's severe and often fatal symptoms.\n"
